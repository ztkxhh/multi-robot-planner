# Multiple Nonholonomic Robots Motion Planning

This repository contains the code for the paper:
**Spatial-Temporal Motion Planning for Multiple Nonholonomic Robots with Safety Constraints**

Authors: Tao Zhang, Yi Dong and Xiaoming Hu

**NOTE: The current version includes mainly compiled files, as the paper is currently under review. The source code will be fully released after the review process is complete. However, emulation verification can still be performed by following the steps outlined below.**

## 1. Software Requirements
* Ubuntu 18.04
* ROS Melodic
* Octomap
* Gurobi

## 2. Setup and Config
#### (1) Install ROS Melodic for Ubuntu 18.04
Follow [ROS Installation](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Installation).

#### (2) Install Gurobi Optimization solver
We use Gurobi to solve the optimization problem, following [Gurobi Download and License instructions](https://www.gurobi.com/downloads/). It's noted that Gurobi needs the license, you can get it for free with an academic E-mail. This helpful [blog](https://blog.csdn.net/tuck_frump/article/details/130991493) guides configuring and using the Gurobi library in a Cmake project on Ubuntu.

#### (3) Install dependencies
```
sudo apt-get install ros-melodic-octomap*
sudo apt-get install ros-melodic-dynamic-edt-3d
```
#### (4) Build
After pre-setting, you can clone this repository to your catkin workspace and catkin_make. A new workspace is recommended.
```
cd ${YOUR_WORKSPACE_PATH}/src
git clone https://github.com/ztkxhh/multi-robot-planner.git
cd ../
catkin_make
source ~/${YOUR_WORKSPACE_PATH}/devel/setup.bash
```

## 3. Run Simulations

#### (1) Simulation Configuration
You can configure the simulation settings in the launch files.

```
robot_radius: the robot implemented in our simulation is considered a circle, and the size is determined by the radius.

robot_count: the number of robots in the simulation.

minimum_order: the order of smoothness optimization, in which "3" represents jerk and "4" represents snap.

bezier_order: the order of the bezier curve.
```


#### (2) Running on warehouse environment

```
roslaunch multi-robot-planner multi-planner-warehouse.launch 
```

#### (3) Running on random environment

```
roslaunch multi-robot-planner multi-planner-random.launch 
```

## 4. Acknowledgements
Our implementation is built on top of [Multi-robot Trajectory Planner](https://github.com/LIJUNCHENG001/multi_robot_traj_planner) and [Btraj](https://github.com/HKUST-Aerial-Robotics/Btraj), we are grateful for their outstanding work.
